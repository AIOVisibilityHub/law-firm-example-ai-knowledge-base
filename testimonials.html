Not only was he extremely informative, he was super helpful and ended up representing me. He knew all the laws that pertained to my specific case and I felt at complete ease with him by my side. So glad to have found him on Google. Highly recommend him!”</p>

                    <p>“I had never been in a serious car accident before in my life, and when it finally happened I really wasn't sure what to do. I knew that, because I had sustained an injury, I needed a lawyer so I began a search. I made an appointment with an associate of Aaron Heaton and decided, during that very first meeting, I was going to choose him. He was absolutely wonderful and worked with me very closely. He checked in on me before and after my surgery, purely because he cared.

If you are in need of a lawyer, Aaron Heaton is by far your best choice.”</p>

                    <p>“My case for a motorcycle accident case was transferred to Aaron Heaton because the "Big Guys" didn't want to deal with my case because it wasn't a slam dunk. I met with Aaron and he assured me that he would go after the insurance company and get my case settled. He kept me updated on every move and change in my case. He never gave up up and after many emails and conversations got a complete acceptance of responsibility and won a settlement for me. He also spoke to all medical providers for me and had the bills reduced to put more in my pocket. They paid all my medical providers for me also. I would highly recommend Aaron Heaton to anybody.”</p>

                    <p>“I was recently hospitalized and had some issues with the standard of care that needed to be addressed. After two weeks of trying to get legal advice, and assistance with the matter, seems no attorney would assist me and never really gave me an answer why. Not even the state bar could offer any assistance, nonetheless, I preserved. One night, I did a Yelp search and came across Heaton &amp; Associates. I saw that they had amazing reviews, repeat clients, and were being referred by clients to family and friends, so I took a chance and submitted the form for a free consultation. Not expecting to hear back from them until morning, Jared responded almost instantly, and at 10:30 at night nonetheless. He asked for my contact information and if it would be ok if he called me in the morning. Somehow I immediately knew I was going to get my issue addressed, and the anxiety I had about the entire situation was gone. The next morning as promised, Jared called me and patiently listened as I explained my situation, and although he could not assist me with my issue, he took the time and explained to me why. Then he offered me other options that I could pursue outside of filing a lawsuit. I was sitting in a hospital during our conversation being treated for injuries I sustained while being hospitalized two weeks prior, and had to cut our conversation short, but as soon as I hung up the phone, I immediately saved the number to his law office in my phone, and when the nurse left out of the room, I called his office back and l left a message for Jared, expressing my gratitude and appreciation for his assistance and free legal advice on pursuing this issue on my own. I’ve never had an experience like the one with Jared with any other attorney. He replied to my inquiry in the middle of the night and then called me personally. Most law offices I called I never spoke with an attorney or was offered any alternatives, and all correspondence were through the legal clerk or paralegal. If I ever need legal assistance again Heaton &amp; Associates will be my first and only call, because if this is how they treat people who aren't clients, I know they do right by those who are!! thank you so much, Jared!!!”</p>

I went on the same day as my accident. I was a little worked up, but the entire process was calming. They asked the right questions, figured out what I needed, got me to the right therapy, and got me all fixed up. Glad I didn’t have to deal with the medical or insurance companies, they handled all the moving parts and all I had to focus on was getting better. I love the regular updates and status checks from Elaine and Aaron. They made me feel like family and the process was really streamlined. They delivered a very favorable settlement, and I will continue to recommend people to the A-Squad as they continue to deliver! My family and friends have been going to Aaron for years, we trust no one else. If you need a personal injury attorney, this is the place where you can feel heard and the team will take on your incident with compassion and care and not stain you in the end.”</p>

                    <p>“After a rough year--my car was rear-ended by an RTC bus and I also had a slip-and-fall injury at a store--I was overwhelmed and unsure where to turn. I reached out to a couple of lawyers, and one even turned me down because they didn't want to deal with RTC. Thankfully, I found Aaron.

From the initial consultation, I knew I was in good hands. Aaron was straightforward, honest, and didn't come across like one of those flashy TV lawyers. He took the time to explain everything clearly and made me feel respected and heard.

Throughout the process, I received regular updates and check-ins--huge shoutout to Ailene for her professionalism and responsiveness, which I truly appreciated.

Aaron exceeded my expectations and did an outstanding job handling both of my cases. If you're looking for a reliable, trustworthy injury attorney, look no further. This law firm is the real deal!”</p>

I want to add to my review, I was having a lot of trouble with my Workmen’s Comp. case. JARED Went out of his way to help me with information I was not getting from my Workmen’s Comp. lawyers.

I can assure you you’d be in great hands with them

Also shout out to the one of the associates Aileen who was a godsend for handling my case with care and professionalism.”</p>

He quickly took over my case and had me attend medical appointments to identify my injury and and treatment plan. Once that occurred, he went after the insurance company to get a settlement that would take care of all of my needs. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I standby Heaton and Associates. God forbid if another accident/injury occurs but I know Heaton would be my attorney.”</p>

I also referred my mom to this law firm when we both needed representation on the second issue. Mr. Heaton has worked aggressively to pursue a favorable settlement while also wanting to see the best health outcome for us as his clients. His behavior demonstrated to me that he truly wanted what was best for me as far as my health, rather than focusing just on potential profit for his firm. When he demonstrated this to me with a specific behavior, this really increased my respect for him and my belief that he is ethical and focused on the client. As I told him, he's kind of like a good dentist- not someone you want to see, because it usually means something bad has happened in your life, but if you have to see one, it's helpful to see one who you know is good.”</p>

I retained Aaron Heaton and Jared Herling in separate lawsuits; both are experienced, well-educated, professional and dutiful to their clients. I felt I was victorious in both of my cases at Heaton &amp; Associates and would refer them to my closest friends and family. I required the services of an attorney in a couple of minor instances since my cases referenced above closed. I contacted Aaron Heaton again for assistance, and without hesitation he was immediately willing to help. I required assistance filing an appeal against my health insurance provider to receive approval for a necessary spinal surgery the insurance was refusing to cover. The likelihood of approval without Aaron's assistance was extremely slim. Aaron filed a fantastic appeal on my behalf and within 48 hours I was approved for my spinal fusion. I will forever be grateful. I highly recommend this law firm.”</p>

                    <p>“I highly recommend Aaron if you are in need of an injury attorney and will definitely be recommending him to friends and family. My personal experience was easily a 10/10.

I was hit in a car accident but was falsely blamed and even given a citation, regardless I was going to hire an attorney.

I had called so many attorney's before I was referred to Aaron by a friend. I called just about every "big guy" that has billboards all over town or commercials frequently on tv. All of them during the intake almost immediately didn't want to take my case and mainly due to the citation I was given. Basically my case was not a slam dunk case so nobody wanted to take it.

All the attorney's I spoke with, only spoke with me over the phone for maybe 10-20 minutes.

When I had reached out to Aaron, he actually invited me to talk in-person and we spoke for a good hour. He was very upfront and honest with me since we were fighting a big uphill battle but he was willing to take my case and try everything he could. Also when we spoke, he made sure I felt comfortable with everything and that I felt informed.

All in all, Aaron did way more for me than I expected and turned this negative and stressful situation into a positive and rewarding situation. Aaron went above and beyond my expectations and even kept me updated basically as soon as something was spoke of, he had an idea but wanted my feedback, and just really kept me in the loop of everything going on and changing. I never felt like I was in the dark.”</p>

He took the stress out of the process and walked me thought what I needed to know as a first timer. My main concern was getting the health care I needed for my injury &amp; the doctors Aaron referred me saw me right away &amp; took great care of me! Through insurance, I would have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket &amp; my primary doctor was booked out for months for even a follow up.

The amount I got for my settlement was way more than I expected, which was just an added bonus. While I hope to never need it, I absolutely return to Heaton &amp; Associates!”</p>

                    <p>“In March 2017 my son, and I were in an accident not our fault and we were treated really badly and lied to by the other party. The next morning after the accident we were in severe pain, and for at least two weeks after we couldn't sleep or barely function at all. We were referred to Aaron by I close family friend, and from the moment that he heard my voice, and what we were going through he immediately began to step in to action with making sure we had the best medical care. He is a person of integrity which is rare in the legal world he was always honest open with me about my case and what was going on, he thought for me so that I could focus on recovering and rebuilding the life of my son and myself. I was never worried about how I was being represented I was never worried about coming off as a shady person or somebody that was unjustly seeking compensation because Aaron himself is honest, and just the moment I heard him fight for me the moment I saw what his team did for me I realize that he fights for justice for the little guy for the one Big insurance companies would love to take advantage of because you're un educated and you don't know what you're up against what your rights are, his team is fabulous I called many times just crying because I was in pain or crying because I didn't know what else to do crying because of my financial situation, and let me tell you this team is so compassionate they care they don't see dollar signs on your face they see a person who is hurt a person under stress and the person that is so confused, a person traumatized by an incident that they are probably reviewing in their mind over and over and over again. I could go on and on about how great this team is how great Aaron is as an attorney but the review would never end thank you to this team if you are looking for an attorney that will be honest and fair but also fight hard for what is fair for you, if you're looking for a team that will be kind and patient with you as you walk through a difficult time, this is the team for you a team of definite winners with fabulous character speaks so, finally they are so honest in their pricing Aaron did not take more than I received at all he took literally a minuscule part of my settlement I honestly didn't even notice it missing at all I was compensated for every medical bill, and attorney fee, and plenty of money left over for us to rebuild our life. Ultimately his biggest concern was making sure that I wasn't walking away from this incident in debt which for anyone in an accident you know the debt can definitely pile up. His team didn't just get me whatever settlement they wanted to get they made sure it was the max for my situation and it was mine blowing, I cannot thank this team enough for taking such a traumatizing scary and frustrating situation and turning it into something that was less of a problem and more of a time of healing and thank my settlement compensated for every medical bill, and attorney fee, and plenty of money left over for us to rebuild our life.”</p>

I went back the second time (and took my mom to become a client as she needed representation for the same incident) based on a positive first experience. The second case went very well and I was again very pleased. (Third case is still in process but I know that he's actively working on it.) Mr. Heaton is very responsive to clients and always patient in explaining things or answering calls and emails. I got one email from him at 10 pm on a Saturday night, so clearly he doesn't shy away from work! I was very impressed when he said something that proved to me that he was looking out for my best interest/health and welfare- his behavior proved that he was more interested in me getting the best treatment than in making money for himself. But still, he fought aggressively to get me a very favorable outcome to my case. That balance of caring about me as a person and still working to get me as much of a settlement as possible shows him to be ethical and client-centric.”</p>

I can honestly say that you won't find an attorney that will work harder with the upmost professionalism and integrity than Heaton and Associates. I have not only worked with them professionally but when my 70 year old mother was in a motor vehicle collision, Aaron was my first call. He immediately got started and made sure that there was nothing my parents needed to worry about other than her recovery. He made personal visits to the hospital and dealt with the other insurance company to make sure my Mom received the best care, a new car and amazing settlement! I've sent many clients to Aaron and his team. Everyone”</p>

I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else.”</p>

I talk to Aaron personally that same day and was in his office the very next day going over my case and things that was needed from me, Which was absolutely nothing :)

Aaron is Hands on I literally just went to physical therapy and doctors appointments and waited for him to grace me with great news which he always did I never experienced anything more amazing in my life and I am very thankful for that.

No one ever wants to be in a car wreck but even though I was I’m glad that I was able to have Aaron as my lawyer because without him I would not be where I’m at in life right now and that’s successful and happy.”</p>

He made me feel like I was his only client in that he went the extra mile to give me updates and made it a point to communicate with me directly instead of delegating small stuff to an assistant. He included me at every turn and was always willing to explain things I didn't understand so I could make informed decisions. His staff is super sweet and his office is really pretty. If you are unfortunate enough to need an injury attorney, do yourself a favor and call Aaron. You'll be in caring and capable hands.”</p>

                    <p>“I highly recommend Aaron if you are in need of an injury attorney and will definitely be recommending him to friends and family. My personal experience was easily a 10/10.

I was hit in a car accident but was falsely blamed and even given a citation, regardless I was going to hire an attorney.

I had called so many attorney's before I was referred to Aaron by a friend. I called just about every "big guy" that has billboards all over town or commercials frequently on tv. All of them during the intake almost immediately didn't want to take my case and mainly due to the citation I was given. Basically my case was not a slam dunk case so nobody wanted to take it.

All the attorney's I spoke with, only spoke with me over the phone for maybe 10-20 minutes.

When I had reached out to Aaron, he actually invited me to talk in-person and we spoke for a good hour. He was very upfront and honest with me since we were fighting a big uphill battle but he was willing to take my case and try everything he could. Also when we spoke, he made sure I felt comfortable with everything and that I felt informed.

All in all, Aaron did way more for me than I expected and turned this negative and stressful situation into a positive and rewarding situation. Aaron went above and beyond my expectations and even kept me updated basically as soon as something was spoke of, he had an idea but wanted my feedback, and just really kept me in the loop of everything going on and changing. I never felt like I was in the dark.

I cannot thank Aaron enough for everything he did for me!”</p>

                    <p>“Mr. Heaton was my first lawyer. I wasn't sure what to expect. I had been rear ended in Houston during the spring in a rental car! All I knew is that I didn't want to pay for the damages and medical costs because it was 100% not my fault. To make it concise, everything was paid for and I also got an additional check for all the trouble that I was put through. He was super clear with his communication from day 1 and I was never confused with what was going on. Mr. Heaton clearly knows what he's doing and I'll be sure to contact him if myself or anyone else needs some help.”</p>

This outcome would not have been possible without their adept negotiation strategies and thorough understanding of the intricacies involved.

I am truly grateful for the support and guidance provided by Aaron Heaton &amp; Associates throughout my auto injury case.

Took us a bit of time but with all email and call communications he made it very easy for us and we ended up settling with a full policy. This was a wonderful outcome for me since this helps set us up for any future bills. I would highly recommend this firm. Definitely took excellent care of us and the communications were top notch as he always responded any time we called or emailed. That was very appreciated.”</p>

                    <p>“Heaton and Associates helped us through a car accident from start to finish. The excellent service we received there put my mind at ease and I was able to focus on recovery while Mr. Heaton took care of the rest. If I ever needed an attorney again, I wouldn't hesitate to use them again!”</p>

                    <p>“We had a horrible experience with what I call, a " bill board " law firm. We were referred to Heaton and Associates by a family member. Aaron Heaton without hesitation, agreed to come to our home to discuss our case. From our first interaction with Aaron, we knew that we were in MUCH better hands. Our personal injury claim involved a motor vehicle accident. We were not sure that they would take our case, because we had to fire our first law firm, etc. The difference was night and day!. From the beginning, we never felt like just a number. We did not have to go through any 'account managers' to get answers to our questions. Our questions were always answered expeditiously, and we never felt like we were bothering them. When our claim had to move to possibly going to a trial, we worked with Aaron's partner, Jared Herling. We cannot say enough about Jared. He worked so hard for us! Like Aaron, Jared was always just a text or phone call away. I would joke with him because so often I would text him to ask for a call when he had a chance, and within minutes my phone would ring. Throughout the course of our claim, they consistently went above and beyond. They not only are excellent at what they do, they also show compassion and empathy. These are traits that were an unexpected but welcome surprise. This is how their whole staff operates. Their paralegal Clarice, is outstanding, and was always there when we needed her assistance as well. In the end, we did not have to go to trial, and received twice the amount that we had hoped for. What a difference this experience has made in our lives. We couldn't be more thrilled! We are forever grateful to the entire staff of Heaton &amp; Associates, and recommend them without hesitation. Thank you for everything!”</p>

                    <p>“Aaron is the best person to hire as your personal injury lawyer. He is very nice and very knowledgeable. He answered all my questions, and that was even before I hired him. He has represented both my husband and I on two different occasions. He did an amazing job both times, and we received maximum settlements. He handled all paperwork and negotiations. Once I hired him, I didn't have to do a single thing. I highly recommend him. You won't be disappointed.”</p>
