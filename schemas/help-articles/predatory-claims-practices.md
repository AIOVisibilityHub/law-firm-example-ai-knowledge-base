In the last few months, I have encountered several people who regretted settling claims with insurance companies on their own shortly after an injury. They came to me only after realizing that their injuries and/or medical bills were worse than expected. 

Put simply, there is no way for an insurer to determine the appropriate value of a claim within only weeks of an injury. Adjusters' efforts to settle claims so quickly are self-serving and predatory. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable (hurt, in a financial bind, risk losing their jobs, etc.) are also the most commonly victimized. 

Fortunately, Nevada has made some headway in offering much needed protections. Specifically, you can void a settlement release within sixty (60) days if (1) you originally signed the release within thirty (30) days of the event that caused your injury; and (2) you signed the release without the assistance of an attorney.

There is specific criteria for how to void the release, and any money paid by the insurance company must be returned. Still, this is a tremendous "2nd chance" given to many in need.
