I play quite a bit of chess. With the app on my phone, it's a great way to unwind and connect with people all over the world. The problem is that I'm not always in the best state of mind when I log on. Frustration and anger can get in the way of strategy. 

I've found that, in both chess and negotiation, anger is the fastest way to lose. When I play chess angry, I am guaranteed to make mistakes. It's not an emotional game. It's about reading the board and predicting action and reaction.
