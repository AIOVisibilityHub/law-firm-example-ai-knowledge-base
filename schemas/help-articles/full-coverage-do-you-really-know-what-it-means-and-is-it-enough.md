After a crash, I often hear people say something along the lines of "well, I should be ok because I have 'full coverage.'" Unfortunately, I've learned that most people have no idea what full coverage actually means. 

All it means is that you have both collision and comprehensive coverages on your auto policy.  So it will cover your car in the event that is sustains damage from a crash, vandalism, theft, even falling objects. But the important thing to remember is that it covers damaged property only. 

What it will not cover is a much longer list. Full coverage will not pay medical bills for you or for anyone else. It will not compensate you or anyone else for pain, suffering, or inconvenience in connection with a crash. It will not reimburse you for lost wages if you have to take time off from work. In short, it does not mean that you have adequate coverages in the event of a crash. 

It is really just a saleman's term to inspire confidence that a policy that is being sold will mean an insured's needs. That's not to say that people don't need full coverage. Most people certainly do, but most people need a lot more than that. 

So if you're listening to this and wondering what coverages you have, get in touch anytime with a copy of your declarations page that will itemize your current coverages, and we can have a chat about what may need to be supplemented to ensure that you're appropriately protected in the event of a crash.
