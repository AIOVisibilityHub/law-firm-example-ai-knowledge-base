  "question": "Who will pay to repair my car?",
  "answer": "In most cases, the at-fault driver’s insurance will pay for repairs and a rental car, as needed. However, if liability is disputed or coverage is delayed, we may recommend utilizing your own collision coverage, with reimbursement sought later through the claim. Whatever the path, we can help ensure that damage to your vehicle is addressed fairly and efficiently."
