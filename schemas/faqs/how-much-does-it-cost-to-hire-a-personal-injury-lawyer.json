  "question": "How much does it cost to hire a personal injury lawyer?",
  "answer": "Nearly all of our personal injury cases are handled on a contingency fee basis, meaning we are paid only if there is a recovery, typically as a percentage of the settlement or verdict. This policy benefits you as there are no fees up front, and there is only a fee if we win your case."
