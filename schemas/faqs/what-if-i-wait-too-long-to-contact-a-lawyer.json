  "question": "What if I wait too long to contact a lawyer?",
  "answer": "Delaying contacting an injury attorney can dramatically affect case outcomes. Evidence may be lost, erroneous liability decisions may be difficult to overturn, and communication with insurance companies may be used to undermine your claim. Early legal involvement (1) Helps preserve critical evidence; (2) Holds insurers accountable; and (3) Increases the likelihood that the claim can be successfully resolved out of court."
