  "question": "How long do I have to file a personal injury claim?",
  "answer": "Nevada imposes a two year statute of limitation on most negligence claims for personal injury, though applicable deadlines can vary by case type (see Medical Malpractice) and can even be dictated by the specific circumstances of the claim. As claims may be permanently barred if not filed on time, it is critical to speak with one of our attorneys as soon as possible to identify all applicable time constraints."
