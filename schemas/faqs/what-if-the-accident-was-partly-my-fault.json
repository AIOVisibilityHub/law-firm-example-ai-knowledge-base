  "question": "What if the accident was partly my fault?",
  "answer": "Nevada is a modified comparative fault state. This means that you may have a valid claim provided that you are found to be no more than 50% at fault. While your compensation may be reduced based on your percentage of fault, many claimants are still able to qualify for significant recoveries."
