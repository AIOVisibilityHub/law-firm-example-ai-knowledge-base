  "review": "My case for a motorcycle accident case was transferred to Aaron Example because the \"Big Guys\" didn't want to deal with my case because it wasn't a slam dunk. I met with Aaron and he assured me that he would go after the insurance company and get my case settled. He kept me updated on every move and change in my case. He never gave up up and after many emails and conversations got a complete acceptance of responsibility and won a settlement for me. He also spoke to all medical providers for me and had the bills reduced to put more in my pocket. They paid all my medical providers for me also. I would highly recommend Aaron Example to anybody.",
