  "review": "Mr. Example was my first lawyer. I wasn't sure what to expect. I had been rear ended in Houston during the spring in a rental car! All I knew is that I didn't want to pay for the damages and medical costs because it was 100% not my fault. To make it concise, everything was paid for and I also got an additional check for all the trouble that I was put through. He was super clear with his communication from day 1 and I was never confused with what was going on. Mr. Example clearly knows what he's doing and I'll be sure to contact him if myself or anyone else needs some help.",
