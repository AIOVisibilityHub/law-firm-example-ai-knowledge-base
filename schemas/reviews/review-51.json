  "review": "Absolutely amazing!!! Aaron and his team are by far the best injury attorneys out there. I own a small business and we work with multiple personal injury attorneys. I can honestly say that you won't find an attorney that will work harder with the upmost professionalism and integrity than Heaton and Associates. I have not only worked with them professionally but when my 70 year old mother was in a motor vehicle collision, Aaron was my first call. He immediately got started and made sure that there was nothing my parents needed to worry about other than her recovery. He made personal visits to the hospital and dealt with the other insurance company to make sure my Mom received the best care, a new car and amazing settlement! I've sent many clients to Aaron and his team. Everyone ",
