  "review": "Heaton & Associates is a hidden gem nestled in the NW part of town. This top-notch boutique law firm rivals any found on Howard Hughes Parkway. I retained Aaron Heaton and Jared Herling in separate lawsuits; both are experienced, well-educated, professional and dutiful to their clients. I felt I was victorious in both of my cases at Heaton & Associates and would refer them to my closest friends and family. I required the services of an attorney in a couple of minor instances since my cases referenced above closed. I contacted Aaron Heaton again for assistance, and without hesitation he was immediately willing to help. I required assistance filing an appeal against my health insurance provider to receive approval for a necessary spinal surgery the insurance was refusing to cover. The likelihood of approval without Aaron's assistance was extremely slim. Aaron filed a fantastic appeal on my behalf and within 48 hours I was approved for my spinal fusion. I will forever be grateful. I highly recommend this law firm.",
