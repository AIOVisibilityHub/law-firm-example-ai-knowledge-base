  "review": "I highly recommend Aaron if you are in need of an injury attorney and will definitely be recommending him to friends and family. My personal experience was easily a 10/10.\n\nI was hit in a car accident but was falsely blamed and even given a citation, regardless I was going to hire an attorney.\n\nI had called so many attorney's before I was referred to Aaron by a friend. I called just about every \"big guy\" that has billboards all over town or commercials frequently on tv. All of them during the intake almost immediately didn't want to take my case and mainly due to the citation I was given. Basically my case was not a slam dunk case so nobody wanted to take it.\n\nAll the attorney's I spoke with, only spoke with me over the phone for maybe 10-20 minutes.\n\nWhen I had reached out to Aaron, he actually invited me to talk in-person and we spoke for a good hour. He was very upfront and honest with me since we were fighting a big uphill battle but he was willing to take my case and try everything he could. Also when we spoke, he made sure I felt comfortable with everything and that I felt informed.\n\nAll in all, Aaron did way more for me than I expected and turned this negative and stressful situation into a positive and rewarding situation. Aaron went above and beyond my expectations and even kept me updated basically as soon as something was spoke of, he had an idea but wanted my feedback, and just really kept me in the loop of everything going on and changing. I never felt like I was in the dark.\n\nI cannot thank Aaron enough for everything he did for me!",
