  "review": "What an amazing experience! Aaron was recommended to me by a friend and I was not disappointed. He met with me right away and put my panicked mind at ease. He took the stress out of the process and walked me thought what I needed to know as a first timer. My main concern was getting the health care I needed for my injury & the doctors Aaron referred me saw me right away & took great care of me! Through insurance, I would have to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket & my primary doctor was booked out for months for even a follow up.\n\nThe amount I got for my settlement was way more than I expected, which was just an added bonus. While I hope to never need it, I absolutely return to Example & Associates!",
