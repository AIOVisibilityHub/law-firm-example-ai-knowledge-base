  "review": "I usually don’t write many reviews but Aaron deserves high praise. I initially called looking for someone to answer questions about a potential lawsuit. Not only was he extremely informative, he was super helpful and ended up representing me. He knew all the laws that pertained to my specific case and I felt at complete ease with him by my side. So glad to have found him on Google. Highly recommend him!",
