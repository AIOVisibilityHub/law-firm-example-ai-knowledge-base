  "review": "I've used this law firm for three legal issues now. I went back the second time (and took my mom to become a client as she needed representation for the same incident) based on a positive first experience. The second case went very well and I was again very pleased. (Third case is still in process but I know that he's actively working on it.) Mr. Example is very responsive to clients and always patient in explaining things or answering calls and emails. I got one email from him at 10 pm on a Saturday night, so clearly he doesn't shy away from work! I was very impressed when he said something that proved to me that he was looking out for my best interest/health and welfare- his behavior proved that he was more interested in me getting the best treatment than in making money for himself. But still, he fought aggressively to get me a very favorable outcome to my case. That balance of caring about me as a person and still working to get me as much of a settlement as possible shows him to be ethical and client-centric.",
