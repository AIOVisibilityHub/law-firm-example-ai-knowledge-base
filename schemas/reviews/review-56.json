  "review": "First off, the entire team rocks. There should be a ten-star review, five is not enough. Thank you, Aaron and team! Easy to work with and they have full transparency. I went on the same day as my accident. I was a little worked up, but the entire process was calming. They asked the right questions, figured out what I needed, got me to the right therapy, and got me all fixed up. Glad I didn’t have to deal with the medical or insurance companies, they handled all the moving parts and all I had to focus on was getting better. I love the regular updates and status checks from Elaine and Aaron. They made me feel like family and the process was really streamlined. They delivered a very favorable settlement, and I will continue to recommend people to the A-Squad as they continue to deliver! My family and friends have been going to Aaron for years, we trust no one else. If you need a personal injury attorney, this is the place where you can feel heard and the team will take on your incident with compassion and care and not stain you in the end.",
