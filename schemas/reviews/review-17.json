I talk to Aaron personally that same day and was in his office the very next day going over my case and things that was needed from me, Which was absolutely nothing :)\n\nAaron is Hands on I literally just went to physical therapy and doctors appointments and waited for him to grace me with great news which he always did I never experienced anything more amazing in my life and I am very thankful for that.\n\nNo one ever wants to be in a car wreck but even though I was I’m glad that I was able to have Aaron as my lawyer because without him I would not be where I’m at in life right now and that’s successful and happy.",
