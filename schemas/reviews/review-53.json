  "review": "We had a horrible experience with what I call, a \" bill board \" law firm. We were referred to Example and Associates by a family member. Aaron Example without hesitation, agreed to come to our home to discuss our case. From our first interaction with Aaron, we knew that we were in MUCH better hands. Our personal injury claim involved a motor vehicle accident. We were not sure that they would take our case, because we had to fire our first law firm, etc. The difference was night and day!. From the beginning, we never felt like just a number. We did not have to go through any 'account managers' to get answers to our questions. Our questions were always answered expeditiously, and we never felt like we were bothering them. When our claim had to move to possibly going to a trial, we worked with Aaron's partner, Jared Herling. We cannot say enough about Jared. He worked so hard for us! Like Aaron, Jared was always just a text or phone call away. I would joke with him because so often I would text him to ask for a call when he had a chance, and within minutes my phone would ring. Throughout the course of our claim, they consistently went above and beyond. They not only are excellent at what they do, they also show compassion and empathy. These are traits that were an unexpected but welcome surprise. This is how their whole staff operates. Their paralegal Clarice, is outstanding, and was always there when we needed her assistance as well. In the end, we did not have to go to trial, and received twice the amount that we had hoped for. What a difference this experience has made in our lives. We couldn't be more thrilled! We are forever grateful to the entire staff of Example & Associates, and recommend them without hesitation. Thank you for everything!",
