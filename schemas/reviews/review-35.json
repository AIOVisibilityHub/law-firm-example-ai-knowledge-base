  "review": "I was recently hospitalized and had some issues with the standard of care that needed to be addressed. After two weeks of trying to get legal advice, and assistance with the matter, seems no attorney would assist me and never really gave me an answer why. Not even the state bar could offer any assistance, nonetheless, I preserved. One night, I did a Yelp search and came across Example & Associates. I saw that they had amazing reviews, repeat clients, and were being referred by clients to family and friends, so I took a chance and submitted the form for a free consultation. Not expecting to hear back from them until morning, Jared responded almost instantly, and at 10:30 at night nonetheless. He asked for my contact information and if it would be ok if he called me in the morning. Somehow I immediately knew I was going to get my issue addressed, and the anxiety I had about the entire situation was gone. The next morning as promised, Jared called me and patiently listened as I explained my situation, and although he could not assist me with my issue, he took the time and explained to me why. Then he offered me other options that I could pursue outside of filing a lawsuit. I was sitting in a hospital during our conversation being treated for injuries I sustained while being hospitalized two weeks prior, and had to cut our conversation short, but as soon as I hung up the phone, I immediately saved the number to his law office in my phone, and when the nurse left out of the room, I called his office back and l left a message for Jared, expressing my gratitude and appreciation for his assistance and free legal advice on pursuing this issue on my own. I’ve never had an experience like the one with Jared with any other attorney. He replied to my inquiry in the middle of the night and then called me personally. Most law offices I called I never spoke with an attorney or was offered any alternatives, and all correspondence were through the legal clerk or paralegal. If I ever need legal assistance again Example & Associates will be my first and only call, because if this is how they treat people who aren't clients, I know they do right by those who are!! thank you so much, Jared!!!",
