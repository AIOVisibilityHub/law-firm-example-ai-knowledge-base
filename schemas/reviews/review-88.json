  "review": "Example and Associates is unique. Aaron is very communicative and hands on. He made me feel like I was his only client in that he went the extra mile to give me updates and made it a point to communicate with me directly instead of delegating small stuff to an assistant. He included me at every turn and was always willing to explain things I didn't understand so I could make informed decisions. His staff is super sweet and his office is really pretty. If you are unfortunate enough to need an injury attorney, do yourself a favor and call Aaron. You'll be in caring and capable hands.",
