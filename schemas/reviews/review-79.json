  "review": "I dealt with Aaron personally over this endeavor. I was t boned by a driver that ran a red light. Aaron was able to collect the maximum amount from all the insured. He was proficient, professional, and personable. He was contactable and helpful. On a more personal note he's an absolute rock solid man, father and husband. I'm from a very anti litigious family and he helped me with the guilt of asking for compensation for my injuries and totaled vehicle.",
