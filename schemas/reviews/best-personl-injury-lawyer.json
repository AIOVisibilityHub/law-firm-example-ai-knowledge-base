  "review": "Aaron is the best person to hire as your personal injury lawyer. He is very nice and very knowledgeable. He answered all my questions, and that was even before I hired him. He has represented both my husband and I on two different occasions. He did an amazing job both times, and we received maximum settlements. He handled all paperwork and negotiations. Once I hired him, I didn't have to do a single thing. I highly recommend him. You won't be disappointed.",
