  "review": "In March 2017 my son, and I were in an accident not our fault and we were treated really badly and lied to by the other party. The next morning after the accident we were in severe pain, and for at least two weeks after we couldn't sleep or barely function at all. We were referred to Aaron by I close family friend, and from the moment that he heard my voice, and what we were going through he immediately began to step in to action with making sure we had the best medical care. He is a person of integrity which is rare in the legal world he was always honest open with me about my case and what was going on, he thought for me so that I could focus on recovering and rebuilding the life of my son and myself. I was never worried about how I was being represented I was never worried about coming off as a shady person or somebody that was unjustly seeking compensation because Aaron himself is honest, and just the moment I heard him fight for me the moment I saw what his team did for me I realize that he fights for justice for the little guy for the one Big insurance companies would love to take advantage of because you're un educated and you don't know what you're up against what your rights are, his team is fabulous I called many times just crying because I was in pain or crying because I didn't know what else to do crying because of my financial situation, and let me tell you this team is so compassionate they care they don't see dollar signs on your face they see a person who is hurt a person under stress and the person that is so confused, a person traumatized by an incident that they are probably reviewing in their mind over and over and over again. I could go on and on about how great this team is how great Aaron is as an attorney but the review would never end thank you to this team if you are looking for an attorney that will be honest and fair but also fight hard for what is fair for you, if you're looking for a team that will be kind and patient with you as you walk through a difficult time, this is the team for you a team of definite winners with fabulous character speaks so, finally they are so honest in their pricing Aaron did not take more than I received at all he took literally a minuscule part of my settlement I honestly didn't even notice it missing at all I was compensated for every medical bill, and attorney fee, and plenty of money left over for us to rebuild our life. Ultimately his biggest concern was making sure that I wasn't walking away from this incident in debt which for anyone in an accident you know the debt can definitely pile up. His team didn't just get me whatever settlement they wanted to get they made sure it was the max for my situation and it was mine blowing, I cannot thank this team enough for taking such a traumatizing scary and frustrating situation and turning it into something that was less of a problem and more of a time of healing and thank my settlement compensated for every medical bill, and attorney fee, and plenty of money left over for us to rebuild our life.",
