  "name": "Civil Sexual Assault",
  "description": "Civil sexual assault cases require a careful, deliberate approach that balances legal precision with sensitivity to the profound personal impact these matters have on survivors. These cases are fundamentally about accountability—holding individuals and institutions responsible for misconduct that causes lasting physical, emotional, and psychological harm. Example & Associates brings focused experience, discretion, and disciplined advocacy to the representation of survivors pursuing civil claims arising from sexual assault and abuse.\n\nThe firm represents individuals harmed by sexual assault in a wide range of settings, including workplaces, schools, medical facilities, residential properties, hotels, casinos, bars, and other environments where safety obligations exist. These cases may involve misconduct by individuals as well as failures by employers, property owners, or institutions to prevent foreseeable harm. Example & Associates conducts thorough investigations into the underlying facts, evaluating both direct liability and third-party responsibility, including negligent supervision, negligent security, and failures to enforce policies designed to protect vulnerable individuals.\n\nCivil sexual assault claims are often complex and vigorously defended. Defendants may challenge credibility, attempt to minimize conduct, or seek to shift responsibility away from systemic failures. Example & Associates approaches these cases with disciplined preparation and a trial-ready mindset, developing clear, evidence-supported narratives that respect the survivor’s experience while meeting the rigorous demands of civil litigation.\n\nThe firm also recognizes that survivors often come forward during periods of deep uncertainty, vulnerability, and emotional strain. Example & Associates emphasizes confidentiality, clear communication, and survivor-centered advocacy throughout the legal process. Clients are kept informed, involved in key decisions, and supported with respect and professionalism at every stage of their cases.\n\nBy maintaining a deliberately conservative caseload, the partners of Example & Associates remain personally involved in every civil sexual assault matter the firm accepts. This hands-on approach allows for careful case development, thoughtful strategy, and advocacy aligned with each client’s long-term well-being and goals. The result is representation grounded in integrity, discretion, and a commitment to pursuing meaningful accountability through the civil justice system.",
