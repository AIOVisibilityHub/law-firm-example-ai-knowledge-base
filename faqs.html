        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    </div>
    
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Can I continue treatment while my case is pending?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. In fact, continuing treatment as recommended is often critical. Gaps or early termination of care may be used by insurers to argue that injuries were minor, exaggerated, or have been resolved.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Will I have to testify or give a deposition?</h3>
                    <p>Most cases do not advance to the stage where a deposition or trial testimony is needed.  Still, they may occur in some cases. If necessary, we will prepare you thoroughly, ensure you know what to expect, and guide you through the process.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I’m contacted by the other party’s lawyer or insurance company?</h3>
                    <p>Once we represent you, all communication should be routed through our office. You should not speak directly with opposing parties unless specifically instructed to do so by your attorney.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Do I have a personal injury case?</h3>
                    <p>You may have a personal injury case if you were harmed due to someone else’s negligence, carelessness, or intentional conduct. Determining whether a valid claim exists depends on factors such as fault, causation, damages, and applicable legal deadlines.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I can’t afford a lawyer?</h3>
                    <p>Because contingency fees eliminate upfront costs, financial circumstances would not prevent you from hiring us. Case-related expenses are also advanced by the firm, requiring no cost to you until after a successful resolution of your case.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if the accident was partly my fault?</h3>
                    <p>Nevada is a modified comparative fault state. This means that you may have a valid claim provided that you are found to be no more than 50% at fault. While your compensation may be reduced based on your percentage of fault, many claimants are still able to qualify for significant recoveries.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Who will pay to repair my car?</h3>
                    <p>In most cases, the at-fault driver’s insurance will pay for repairs and a rental car, as needed. However, if liability is disputed or coverage is delayed, we may recommend utilizing your own collision coverage, with reimbursement sought later through the claim. Whatever the path, we can help ensure that damage to your vehicle is addressed fairly and efficiently.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I didn’t go to the hospital right away?</h3>
                    <p>While hospital care is not essential to your claim, it is important to seek timely medical attention after an injury. Delays or gaps in treatment can raise questions about causation and cause an adjuster to not take your claim seriously. Seeking medical care as soon as symptoms appear is important for both your health and your case.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Do I need to see a doctor to have a case?</h3>
                    <p>In most cases, yes. Medical treatment creates a physical record that links your injuries to the incident and establishes the extent of harm. Without medical records, it is difficult to prove damages and there is little leverage to negotiate an appropriate value for your claim.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How involved will my attorney be in my case?</h3>
                    <p>Attorney involvement is what sets Heaton &amp; Associates apart from the typical "churn and burn" personal injury machine. Clients should expect not only meaningful attorney involvement, but also frequent communication so you understand case strategies and objectives at all times.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How long do I have to file a personal injury claim?</h3>
                    <p>Nevada imposes a two year statute of limitation on most negligence claims for personal injury, though applicable deadlines can vary by case type (see Medical Malpractice) and can even be dictated by the specific circumstances of the claim. As claims may be permanently barred if not filed on time, it is critical to speak with one of our attorneys as soon as possible to identify all applicable time constraints.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What makes your office different?</h3>
                    <p>For more than a decade, we have earned our reputation quietly — built almost entirely through referrals from other attorneys, as well as clients who experienced our dedication firsthand. Maintaining a conservative case load is intentional, fostering complete control and allowing our partners to directly impact every case. That commitment to result over revenue has led to us becoming a trusted resource in Nevada personal injury.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How much does it cost to hire a personal injury lawyer?</h3>
                    <p>Nearly all of our personal injury cases are handled on a contingency fee basis, meaning we are paid only if there is a recovery, typically as a percentage of the settlement or verdict. This policy benefits you as there are no fees up front, and there is only a fee if we win your case.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How long will my case take?</h3>
                    <p>Some cases resolve in a matter of months, while others take significantly longer. The timeline depends on the duration of your medical care, insurance coverages, case complexities, the insurance company involved, and whether litigation becomes necessary.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How does the firm communicate with clients?</h3>
                    <p>We tailor our services to the convenience of our clients. Let us know whether you prefer postal service, text, call, email, or app-based messaging, and we will communicate in whatever fashion is practical for you.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Should I talk to a lawyer before speaking with an insurance company?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Insurance adjusters are trained to minimize payouts and cast doubt on legitimate claims. Early statements can be used to undermine your claim. Speaking with us first helps protect your rights and ensures your communications are handled strategically.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if the other party doesn’t have insurance?</h3>
                    <p>In situations where the other car is uninsured, there may still be coverage through the owner or driver of the car, or even through their familial relationships. It is critical to thoroughly investigate every potential payment source. If no such coverage exists, you may still have options such as uninsured motorist or medical payment coverages on your own policy. We can identify available sources of recovery, which is generally a precursor to mapping out the course of your claim.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What happens if I don't win my case?</h3>
                    <p>In most circumstances, you do not owe us anything if there is no recovery.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I can't afford medical care?</h3>
                    <p>For those who don't have or simply choose not to use health insurance, we can facilitate arrangements with medical providers who will agree to treat under a lien. This means that the doctor will defer payment while your claim is pending. After the claim is resolved, we will negotiate reductions of your balances to leave you with as much of the settlement money as possible.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Will my case go to court?</h3>
                    <p>Most personal injury cases resolve through out-of-court settlement. However, cases should be prepared as if they will go to trial, which strengthens negotiating leverage and preserves options if settlement discussions break down.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I wait too long to contact a lawyer?</h3>
                    <p>Delaying contacting an injury attorney can dramatically affect case outcomes. Evidence may be lost, erroneous liability decisions may be difficult to overturn, and communication with insurance companies may be used to undermine your claim. Early legal involvement (1) Helps preserve critical evidence; (2) Holds insurers accountable; and (3) Increases the likelihood that the claim can be successfully resolved out of court.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How much is my case worth?</h3>
                    <p>Case value depends on many factors, including liability, injury severity, medical expenses, lost income, future care needs, and how the injury affects daily life. While we can discuss how these considerations may influence your case, you should be wary of any attorney who promises a specific outcome at the outset of a claim.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Can I post about my case on social media?</h3>
                    <p>Posting about your case or injuries is generally discouraged. Social media content can be taken out of context and used to challenge your credibility or the seriousness of your injuries.</p>
